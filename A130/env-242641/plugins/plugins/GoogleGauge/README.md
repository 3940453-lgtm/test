# Gauge Visualization

Capture a key metric using a dial with a needle that points to a specific point in a data range. A gauge chart resembles a speedometer or gauge, with the outer ring of the dial color-coded to provide additional insight. For example, green can be used to indicate a good or acceptable value and red can be used to indicate a bad or unacceptable value.

Gauge charts are often used on executive dashboards, with each displaying a single key measure and allowing executives to quickly determine whether key metrics are performing well or falling below accepted values.
