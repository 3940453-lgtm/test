# Funnel Visualization

Visualize the progressive reduction of data as it passes from one stage to another. Data in each stage is represented as a unique color and a different portion of 100%.

Funnel charts are commonly used to visualize the evolution of the stages in a process, for example, to show executives how effective the sales team is in turning a sales lead into a closed deal. Sales leads are on top, followed by qualified leads, then hot leads, and finally closed deals. The narrowing sections as you move from the top section (the widest) to the bottom section (the narrowest) show how potential deals are reduced at each step in the sales process.
