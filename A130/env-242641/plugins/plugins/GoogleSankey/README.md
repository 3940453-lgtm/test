# Sankey Diagram Visualization

Visualize the flow from one set of values to another to gain insight into relative contributions.  Sankey diagrams visually emphasize the major transfers or flows within a system, helping users locate dominant contributions to an overall flow.

Sankey diagrams are a great choice when you want to show a many-to-many mapping between two domains - such as retail categories and individual items - or multiple paths through a set of stages - such as how traffic flows from one page to another on a web site.     

A fun fact about this visualization is that it is named after Captain Sankey, who created a diagram of steam engine efficiency that used arrows with widths proportional to heat loss.
